# Python_ML_Workshop
Welcome to the **"Machine Learning Basics with Python"** Workshop.\
I'm Evam Kaushik and I've prepared this repository to help you get started for the upcoming workshop hopefully helping you set up a development environment on your local PC/Laptop. To take full benefit of the workshop I suggest you go through this repository very thoroughly and perform all the activities in the specified order.\
Let's get started.

## Installing Anaconda
We will now be downloading Anaconda, which is a very powerful distribution of Python that focuses on scientific computing. Depending on your operating system choose a suitable file and the download will begin immediately. Note that the file size is nearly 500 MB so make sure you have a stable internet connection.\
* Windows users download [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Windows-x86_64.exe)
* MacOs users download [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg)
* Linux users download [here](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.02-Linux-x86_64.sh) \
Now run the downloaded file and it will install **Anaconda Navigator**, **Anaconda Powershell Prompt** and **Anaconda Prompt** onto your system as <br>

Now go ahead and open **Anaconda Powershell Prompt**. <br>
You will now be able to see a window like <br> <br>

## Creating an Environment
So now that you have installed Anaconda and opened Anaconda Powershell Prompt, you can head over to installing the required libraries. <br>
These libraries are important packages that our program will need in order to <br>Go to [this](https://github.com/kickereb/Python_ML_Workshop/blob/master/script.txt) link and copy all the text from the file. Now paste this text into the Prompt window.(Note that you will have to use 'ctrl+v' shortcut to paste into the prompt window.) <br>

Now press enter and it should ask you to procede to which press 'y' and then enter. After this it will begin a download sequence and create an environment.  <br>

After ansering all necessary 'Proceed ([y]/n)?' with a 'y', you will end up with
